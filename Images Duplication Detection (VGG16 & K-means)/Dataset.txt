The core task of the project is to detect duplication in images.
For this reason a kaggle dataset whose link is given below is adopted.
Notice that the original images are categorized into 3 separate categories (Cats, Dogs, Pandas).
However, for the purpose of this project's goal, download and merge all the images to a single folder.
